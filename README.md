# example-mysql-link-tables
This is an example SQL script for linking an initial Users table to a related table of Hikes stored by Users

It demonstrates how a MySQL table links to another table to begin building a web app.
  
Other tables could be linked from these existing tables, or rebuilt to model different data requirements.

To implement, upload the file via adminer.php (etc) to run the script.

Alter the data, design, add info via adminer and then export the contents to massage further.  Lather, rinse and repeat.
